1.	Explain the difference between useEffect, useLayoutEffect, and useInsertionEffect. When would you use each?
Answer: UseEffect acts like asynchronous, used for side effects for fetching , and handling APIs calls, 
useLayoutEffect acts like synchronous , it is mostly used  for Dom Manipulation . because it will paints before rendering , like dimensions, scrolling etc.
useInsertionEffect : I don’t know much ,because I didn’t used it any where.

2.	What are higher-order components (HOCs)? How do they differ from custom hooks?
Answer: HOC: Higher Order Component it is a function that carries a component as a prop and renders it with additional logics  like in  Authentication.
Custom Hook: it is  also a function with same structure but name should be start with “use” that the component can be used in and calls any where in the project.
Key Difference: hoc is passed as a prop , but where as custom hook will simply called where ever it needed.

3.	Describe how context works in React. What are the potential drawbacks of using React Context for large-scale state management?

4.	What is React’s reconciliation process? How does React determine what to update in the DOM?
Answer:  Reconciliation process will of updating the necessary state or a component rendering with out disturbing the other components in Dom , we know that react provides Virtual Dom so it is has a faster updating of Dom compared to Real Dom.

5.	How would you prevent unnecessary re-renders in a functional component?
1)	Using  the useMemo() to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of component
2)	Using useCallback().
3)	using React.Memo().
4)	using Key prop in while maping.
